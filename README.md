The aim of this assignment is to implement a lexical analyser (scanner) and syntax analyser (parser) using Antlr4 for a simple language called CCAL.

The parser and supporting code must be written in Java. No other target language is acceptable for this assignment.

The parser should take a file name as an input, say file.ccl, and output one of the following messages if the input parsed successfully or did not parse respectively.

file.ccl parsed successfully
file.ccl has not parsed
